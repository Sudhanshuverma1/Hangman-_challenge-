# 🕹️ Hangman Game (Python Implementation)

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to the **Hangman Game** – a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python! This simple command-line game challenges players to guess a randomly selected word within **7 attempts**.

---

## 🎮 How to Play
1. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
2. The word is displayed as underscores (`_`), representing each letter.
3. You have **7 guesses** to figure out the word.
4. Enter a letter:
   - If it's in the word, it replaces the corresponding underscore(s).
   - If not, you lose a guess.
5. The game ends when:
   - You guess the word correctly (**You Win!** 🎉)
   - You use all 7 attempts (**You Lose!** ❌)
